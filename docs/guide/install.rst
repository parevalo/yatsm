Dependencies
------------

Yet Another TimeSeries Model (YATSM) is written in `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ (version 2.7, but 3.5 is soon to be a priority) and utilizes several C libraries, including the `Geographic Data Abstraction Library <http://www.gdal.org/>`_ (GDAL). Package dependencies are most easily installed using `Conda`_, but may also be installed using your package manager on Linux (see `Ubuntu 14.04`_ example), `Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`_ on Mac OS, or through `OSGEO4W <http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/>`_ on Windows.

However, it is strongly encouraged that you install YATSM into an isolated environment, either using `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_ for ``pip`` installs or a separate environment using conda_, to avoid dependency conflicts with other software.

Conda
-----

Requirements for YATSM may also be installed using conda_, Python's cross-platform and platform agnostic binary package manager from `ContinuumIO <http://continuum.io/>`_. conda_ makes installation of Python packages, especially scientific packages, a breeze because it includes compiled library dependencies that remove the need for a compiler or pre-installed libraries.

Installation instructions for ``conda`` are available on their docs site `conda.pydata.org <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/get-started.html>`_

Since conda_ makes installation so easy, installation through conda_ will install all non-developer dependencies. Install YATSM using conda_ into an isolated environment by using the ``environment.yaml`` file as follows:

.. code:: bash

        # Install
        conda env create -n yatsm -f environment.yaml
        # Activate
        source activate yatsm

And as with ``pip``, you need to install ``YATSM``:

.. code:: bash

        # Install YATSM
        pip install .

virtualenv and pip
------------------

virtualenv
~~~~~~~~~~

Python and GDAL are usually installed on most computing environments that handle geographic data (if not, see an example of installing these dependencies on `Ubuntu 14.04`_). If you wish to install YATSM on a system with these two dependencies but you don't have installation privileges for the Python dependencies, you could install YATSM into a `virtualenv <http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.

`virtualenv` creates isolated Python environments, thus enabling a user without root privileges to install modules. `virtualenv` has the added benefit of enabling the installation of specific module versions for single piece of software.

To set up a `virtualenv`, it must first be available. With root access,

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo pip install virtualenv


Once `virtualenv` is installed, users may create a `virtualenv` for YATSM:

.. code-block:: bash

    virtualenv yatsm_venv

To activate this isolated Python environment from Bash:

.. code-block:: bash

    source yatsm_venv/bin/activate


Your terminal prompt will change, denoting the switch to this newly created isolated Python environment.

pip
~~~

The basic dependencies for YATSM are included in the ``requirements.txt`` file which is by ``pip`` as follows:

.. code:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Additional dependencies are required for some timeseries analysis algorithms or for accelerating the computation in YATSM. These requirements are separate from the common base installation requirements so that YATSM may be more modular:

-  Long term mean phenological calculations from Melaas *et al.*, 2013

   -  Requires the R statistical software environment and the ``rpy2``
      Python to R interface
   -  ``pip install -r requirements/pheno.txt``

-  Computation acceleration

   -  GLMNET Fortran wrapper for accelerating Elastic Net or Lasso
      regularized regression
   -  Numba for speeding up computation through just in time compilation
      (JIT)
   -  ``pip install -r requirements/accel.txt``

A complete installation of YATSM, including acceleration dependencies and additional timeseries analysis dependencies, may be installed using the ``requirements/all.txt`` file:

.. code:: bash

    pip install -r requirements/all.txt


Finally, install YATSM:

.. code:: bash

    # Install YATSM
    pip install .

Ubuntu 14.04
------------

On Ubuntu 14.04, for example, the GDAL build dependencies may be satisfied by installing the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install python2.7-dev
    sudo apt-get install gdal-bin libgdal-dev
    sudo apt-get install python-gdal

This installation guide will also utilize the `pip <http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html>`_ utility for installing Python modules. `pip` may be installed or upgraded following the instructions `here <http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html>`_, but it is usual preferable to use your package manager:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install python-pip

You will also need two font packages for `matplotlib` that are not installed with Ubuntu by default:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev libxft-dev

With the GDAL library and `pip` installed, follow the guide for how to install YATSM below using `virtualenv and pip`_.

Developer Installation
----------------------

If you're interested in helping develop YATSM, you can download the repository using Git and install it in an editable installation:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/ceholden/yatsm.git
    cd yatsm/
    pip install -e .

Documentation may be built using `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ from the `docs` directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd docs/
    make html

Platform Support
----------------

YATSM is developed on Linux (CentOS 6, Arch, and Ubuntu 14.04) and has not been tested on any other platforms, though I have seen it working on Mac OS. I am welcome to any help fixing bugs or better supporting Windows, but I will not try to support Windows myself.
