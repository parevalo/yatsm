~~~~~~~

-  Command line interface uses `click <click.pocoo.org>`__ `#28 <https://github.com/ceholden/yatsm/issues/28>`__

-  Configuration file now uses ``YAML`` format for better organization and more sustainable parsing `#30 <https://github.com/ceholden/yatsm/issues/30>`__
-  Refactor ``robust`` fit into more generalized ``refit`` step. User can generate additional ``[prefix]_coef`` and ``[prefix]_rmse`` results using specified estimators `#33 <https://github.com/ceholden/yatsm/issues/33>`__
-  Tests now use ``py.test`` fixtures for better code reuse
-  Reorganize ``requirements.txt`` organization and documentation
